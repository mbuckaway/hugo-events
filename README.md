# Hugo Events Template

This is an event template designed to be used with the [Hugo Static website generator](http://gohugo.com). The template was borrowed originally from a website I help maintain
and modified to fit into a Hugo Template. The template generates a one page website with eight sections and a top menu. The website is suitable for any event (bike race, running race, etc)
where the information fits. I use it for bike races.

Template is work in progress...
